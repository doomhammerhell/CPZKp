# Benchmarks

This chapter covers the performance characteristics of CPZKp through various benchmarks.

## Overview

CPZKp includes comprehensive benchmarks to measure the performance of:
- Scalar operations
- Elliptic curve operations
- Zero-knowledge proof generation and verification
- Serialization and deserialization

## Running Benchmarks

To run the benchmarks:

```bash
cargo bench
```

## Benchmark Results

### Scalar Operations

Benchmarks for scalar group operations:
- `get_constants`: Measures the performance of retrieving group constants
- `solve_zk_challenge_s`: Measures the performance of solving zero-knowledge challenges

### Elliptic Curve Operations

Benchmarks for elliptic curve operations:
- `get_constants`: Measures the performance of retrieving curve constants
- `solve_zk_challenge_s`: Measures the performance of solving zero-knowledge challenges
- `scale_point`: Measures the performance of point scaling
- `add_points`: Measures the performance of point addition

### Verification

Benchmarks for proof verification:
- `verify`: Measures the performance of verifying zero-knowledge proofs

### Serialization

Benchmarks for serialization and deserialization:
- `serialize_point`: Measures the performance of point serialization
- `deserialize_point`: Measures the performance of point deserialization

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Tips

1. **Batch Processing**
   - Use batch operations when possible
   - Minimize the number of individual operations

2. **Memory Management**
   - Reuse allocated memory when possible
   - Avoid unnecessary allocations

3. **Parallel Processing**
   - Use parallel processing for independent operations
   - Consider using rayon for parallelization

### Performance Trade-offs

1. **Security vs. Performance**
   - Some security measures may impact performance
   - Balance security requirements with performance needs

2. **Memory Usage**
   - More efficient algorithms may use more memory
   - Consider memory constraints in your use case

## Benchmarking Best Practices

1. **Environment**
   - Run benchmarks on a dedicated machine
   - Minimize background processes
   - Use consistent hardware and software configurations

2. **Measurement**
   - Run multiple iterations
   - Use statistical analysis
   - Consider both average and worst-case performance

3. **Documentation**
   - Document benchmark results
   - Track performance changes over time
   - Include hardware and software specifications

## Example Benchmark Results

```text
test scalar_operations ... bench: 123 ns/iter (+/- 5)
test ecc_operations ... bench: 456 ns/iter (+/- 10)
test verification ... bench: 789 ns/iter (+/- 15)
test serialization ... bench: 234 ns/iter (+/- 8)
```

## Performance Monitoring

1. **Continuous Integration**
   - Include benchmarks in CI pipeline
   - Track performance regressions
   - Set performance thresholds

2. **Profiling**
   - Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks
   - Optimize critical paths
   - Monitor memory usage
